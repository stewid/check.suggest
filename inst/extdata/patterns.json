     "You may be importing 1 or more packages that either have functions
with the same name or functions that have the same name as a function
in your package. When this happens, it can be difficult to know which
version of the function you are using. To avoid this, you should
import just the functions you need from a package and no more. Look
for '@import' statements in your roxygen documentation and replace
them, where needed, with '@importFrom <packageame>
<functionname>'. You may need lots of functions from a package and
want to instead import all but one or two functions. You can do that
by changing your '@import' statements to '@rawNamespace
import(<packagename>, except = <functionname>)' to avoid conflicts."

everything works it is good practice to replace them with '\\uxxxx'
